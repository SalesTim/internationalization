## A. INTRODUCTION TO SALESTIM I18N

### Resource Files

I18n in SalesTim is implemented as resource files.  
Resource files are plain [JSON Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), which is an open standard file format that guarantees portability.  

There is a json file for each language/region pair in the `resources` folder:
```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ resources
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ <language>-<region>.json  # language/region pair. For example: "en-us".
```

### Structural overview
Locale files are multi-level JSON objects containing key-value pairs organized in groups and sections, for instance:
```yaml
"home": {
  "myRequests": {
    "opened": "My requests",
    "closed": "Home"
  },
  "newTeam": {
    "opened": "New Team",
    "canceled": "Home",
    "saved": "Home"
  },
  "searched": "Search",
  "team": {
    "opened": "Opening...",
    "initiateTalkToOwners": "Starting conversation..."
  },
  "loggedOut": "Sign-out..."
}
```

### Fallback principles

SalesTim takes care of fallback, such as:
- Language without region: ```en``` -> ```en-us```
- Region to region: ```en-en``` -> ```en-us```
- Language to language: ```zh-cn``` -> ```en-us```

To determine the language to be used, SalesTim is using these information by descending priority:
1. Microsoft Teams language
2. Client / Browser language
3. ``` en-us ``` in last resort

In addition to regular text, individual strings could use the following features:
- HTML (For some specific keys, not recommended)
- Emojis
- Variables
- Plurals

### Variables

Strings may contain variables following the [printf notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string), for instance:
```yaml
{
  "alphabet": "The first 4 letters of the english alphabet are: %s, %s, %s and %s"
}
```

### Plurals

The following keys are supported in strings to handle multiple versions on the same message:
* zero
* one
* many

For instance:
```yaml
{
  "enabled": {
    "zero": "Enabled with no approvers defined",
    "one": "Enabled for 1 approver",
    "many": "Enabled for %s approvers"
  }
}
```

## B. IMPLEMENTATION

SalesTim implements i18n using the following modules:
- Server-side: [i18n Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n)
- Client-side: [browser-i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-i18n)

N.B: Client-side implementation is customized to implement the following capabilities:
- [JS Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for keys.
- Printf notation for strings implemented using the [sprintf-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprintf-js) module.
